#TripLogr

TripLogr is a free utility made in Appcelerator Titanium for tracking journeys and providing a log book style PDF print-out. You can track journeys either manually (by entering in the journey purpose and length via a form) or you can opt to track a journey using GPS and have the app automatically calculate distances. It also includes beacon integration - leave an iBeacon in your car to receive localised push notifications reminding you to log your trips!

TripLogr features a number of open source Titanium libraries and modules. It is meant to be a showcase of what Titanium can do and how you can integrate with numerous open source projects.  In particular, it uses a number of modules and open source libraries made available by the community and showcased during tiConf events in 2014, including:

Titanium MapBox (Adam Paxton) - https://github.com/adampax/titanium-mapbox (tiConf US)

Ti.UI.Templates (Javier Rayon & Sonia Villaneuva) - https://github.com/jaraen/Ti.UX.Templates/ (tiConf EU)

TiBeacon (Martin Hudson) - https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/11242?restoreSearch=true (tiConf EU - note this a paid module with a free trial and a $10 one-time fee)

Bencoding PDF (Benjamin Bahrenburg) - https://github.com/benbahrenburg/benCoding.PDF

Also worth special mention are the following presenters at tiConf who provided great talks and insights into a number of the processes that went into this app, including:
