TripLogr is a free utility made in Appcelerator Titanium for tracking journeys and providing a log book style PDF print-out. You can track journeys either manually (by entering in the journey purpose and length via a form) or you can opt to track a journey using GPS and have the app automatically calculate distances. It also includes beacon integration - leave an iBeacon in your car to receive localised push notifications reminding you to log your trips!

TripLogr features a number of open source Titanium libraries and modules. It is meant to be a showcase of what Titanium can do and how you can integrate with numerous open source projects.  In particular, it uses a number of modules and open source libraries made available by the community and showcased during tiConf events in 2014, including:
